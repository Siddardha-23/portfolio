"""
PDF ATS Parseability Check — verifies the rendered PDF will actually parse
cleanly through real Applicant Tracking Systems.

Real ATSes (Workday, Greenhouse, Taleo, iCIMS, Lever, SmartRecruiters) all
extract text from the uploaded PDF before any keyword matching. If the text
layer is malformed (glyph soup, joined words, missing sections, scrambled
contact info), the candidate's resume is silently dropped — keyword scoring
is irrelevant because the parser never gets that far.

This module runs AFTER ResumeRenderer.generate_pdf produces bytes and
verifies the round-trip: structured JSON → PDF → extracted text → can a
real ATS find each piece? Returns a deterministic 0–100 score + a
breakdown of which checks passed so the frontend can show actionable
diagnostics.

Why this is the strongest signal we can compute:
- No "real ATS API" exists publicly — Workday/Greenhouse are tenant-scoped.
- Every commercial ATS first runs pdf-to-text via the same pdfminer / pypdf
  / pdfplumber pipelines. If pypdf extracts our content cleanly, those
  ATSes will too.
- Glyph corruption (em-dash → undefined, ligature joining, missing spaces)
  is the #1 silent failure mode and is fully deterministic to detect here.
