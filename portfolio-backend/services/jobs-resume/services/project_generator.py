Project Generator — generates a single grounded project per invocation.

Called by ContentAugmenter when page fill is below threshold and project
count < 3, regardless of whether the original resume already has projects.
Output is validated against allowed tech from the resume before being injected.

Rules:
- Ground the project in the candidate's demonstrated skills and experience context
- Match the JD domain (use technologies that align with the JD AND exist in the resume)
- No fake company names, production deployment claims, or invented metrics
- dates field is always empty string
- tech field only contains technologies present in the resume skills or bullets
- bullets: 3 realistic, grounded descriptions — what was built and how

# Shared bullet-quality block injected into both single and batch prompts.
# Centralizes "what makes a good project bullet" so the two prompts can't drift.
# This is the single most important text in the generator — it's what turns a
# tag-cloud bullet ("Built FastAPI microservice ingesting Kafka events with
# Redis caching to detect anomalies") into a defensible-in-interview bullet
# ("Wrote a sliding-window outlier detector that flags transactions deviating
# beyond 3σ from a user's 30-day baseline").

    "BULLET QUALITY — THE REAL ENGINEER TEST (ATS-friendly + interview-defensible)\n"

    "  1. Read like something the candidate would say out loud in an interview.\n"
    "  2. Survive an ATS keyword scan by naming the right tech ONCE, in context.\n"
    "  3. Open with a strong action verb so a recruiter scanning the left edge\n"
    "     of the page sees impact in two seconds.\n\n"
    "STRUCTURE OF EVERY BULLET — follow this shape:\n"
    "  <Strong action verb> + <specific noun (the thing built)> + "
    "<concrete detail: a decision, trade-off, mechanism, or outcome> + "
    "<optional single metric>\n\n"
    "STRONG ACTION VERBS — open EVERY bullet with one of these. Vary them across\n"
    "the bullets; do not start three bullets with 'Built'.\n"
    "  Building: Architected, Engineered, Designed, Implemented, Built, Developed,\n"
    "            Wrote, Modeled, Shipped, Delivered.\n"
    "  Improving: Optimized, Reduced, Accelerated, Streamlined, Refactored,\n"
    "             Hardened, Tuned, Cut.\n"
    "  Deciding:  Chose, Selected, Replaced, Migrated, Consolidated, Standardized.\n"
    "  Owning:    Led, Drove, Established, Spearheaded, Owned, Automated,\n"
    "             Integrated, Indexed, Partitioned, Sharded.\n\n"
    "EACH BULLET MUST CARRY EXACTLY ONE OF THESE FOUR SIGNALS — pick the one that\n"
    "fits, do NOT try to cram all four into a single bullet:\n"
    "  (1) A decision + reason — 'Chose materialized views over an in-memory cache\n"
    "      because the aggregation window exceeded available memory.'\n"
    "  (2) A specific thing built or designed — 'Wrote a sliding-window outlier\n"
    "      detector flagging transactions deviating beyond 3σ from a 30-day user\n"
    "      baseline.'\n"
    "  (3) A trade-off accepted — 'Traded ~200ms of added latency for higher\n"
    "      accuracy by joining against historical baselines before scoring.'\n"
    "  (4) A concrete problem solved — 'Handled out-of-order events by buffering\n"
    "      30 seconds before scoring, eliminating false positives on late-arriving\n"
    "      transactions.'\n\n"
    "ATS-FRIENDLY TECH NAMING — read this carefully, it's the difference between\n"
    "passing and failing modern AI screeners:\n"
    "  • Each bullet names EXACTLY ONE technology from the JD-anchor list, spelled\n"
    "    the way the JD spells it. This is what ATS keyword scanners look for.\n"
    "  • Naming TWO OR MORE tech names in one bullet creates a 'keyword stuffing'\n"
    "    pattern modern AI screeners (and recruiters) recognize and downgrade.\n"
    "  • Across the bullets, cover DIFFERENT JD-anchor technologies — do not name\n"
    "    the same tech in every bullet. The 'tech:' field already lists the full\n"
    "    stack; bullets don't repeat it.\n"
    "  • The tech name must appear as the SUBJECT of a decision or action, NOT as\n"
    "    a tag at the end.\n"
    "    Good: 'Indexed flagged transactions in Elasticsearch for sub-second\n"
    "           forensic queries.'\n"
    "    Bad:  '...using Elasticsearch and Kibana for visualization.'\n\n"
    "HARD 'DO NOT DO' RULES — bullets violating these will be rejected:\n"
    "  • NO semicolons mid-bullet. A semicolon almost always means two unrelated\n"
    "    thoughts stuffed together for keyword density. Split or cut.\n"
    "  • NO tool-chain sentences. Patterns like 'Built X with Y and Z using A and\n"
    "    B' where every capitalized word is a tool name are banned. If a bullet\n"
    "    lists 3+ tool names, it has zero signal — rewrite.\n"
    "  • NO generic direct objects. 'Built service', 'Developed application',\n"
    "    'Implemented system', 'Created platform' — meaningless. The noun must\n"
    "    name what was SPECIFICALLY built: 'fraud rule engine', 'outlier\n"
    "    detector', 'back-pressure controller', 'idempotent job runner'.\n"
    "  • NO weak openers. Never 'Worked on', 'Helped', 'Was involved in',\n"
    "    'Participated in', 'Assisted with', 'Utilized', 'Leveraged'.\n"
    "  • NO filler adjectives. Drop 'robust', 'scalable', 'comprehensive',\n"
    "    'cutting-edge', 'innovative', 'seamless', 'state-of-the-art'.\n"
    "  • AT MOST ONE METRIC per bullet. Two metrics in one sentence is padding —\n"
    "    pick the one that matters.\n"
    "  • BULLET LENGTH: 100-150 characters. Long enough for one real thought,\n"
    "    short enough that every word earns its place.\n\n"
    "SELF-CHECK BEFORE EMITTING EACH BULLET — answer yes to all four:\n"
    "  1. Does it open with a strong action verb (from the list above)?\n"
    "  2. Does it name EXACTLY ONE JD-anchor technology — not zero, not two?\n"
    "  3. Does the action own a SPECIFIC noun an interviewer could probe with\n"
    "     'why did you do it that way?' — and could the candidate answer?\n"
    "  4. Could this exact bullet appear on five other candidates' resumes? If\n"
    "     yes, it's generic — rewrite with a specific detail.\n\n"
    "COMPARISON — this is exactly what to AVOID vs what to WRITE:\n"
    "  REJECTED (keyword stuffing, no decision, ATS recognizes the pattern):\n"
    "    'Built FastAPI microservice ingesting transaction events from Kafka\n"
