Resume Parser — Gemini multi-modal document extraction + structured parsing.

Architecture:
  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
  │ PDF / DOCX   │───>│ Gemini Flash (multi-modal)   │───>│ Validated│
  │ file (bytes) │    │  • Structured JSON parsing    │    │  JSON    │
  │              │    │  • Raw text transcription      │    │  + store │
  │              │    │  • Hyperlink URL extraction     │    │          │
  └──────────────┘    └──────────────────────────────┘    └──────────┘

Model routing:
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash: fast, factual extraction — no hallucination, no rewriting.
  - Multi-modal mode: sends raw file bytes (PDF or DOCX) directly to Gemini
    for visual document understanding. Superior for complex layouts (columns,
    tables, sidebars) and eliminates the need for separate text extraction
    libraries (PyPDF2, python-docx).

Output conforms to PARSED_RESUME_SCHEMA so downstream consumers
(ResumeTailor, ResumeScorer, ProjectGenerator) receive consistent JSON.

Key design decisions:
  1. Strict extraction prompt — prevents the model from inventing or embellishing.
  2. No native schema= enforcement — PARSED_RESUME_SCHEMA uses _dict_of for skills
     (Record<string, string[]>) which Gemini's response_schema API cannot handle.
     Instead, we rely on prompt instructions + post-call validate_and_coerce().
  3. Keyword normalization — standardizes skill names ("JS" → "JavaScript") for
     accurate downstream matching in scoring and gap analysis.
  4. Single-user storage — resumes are replaced (not versioned) in MongoDB.

        """Estimate total years of professional experience from date ranges.

        Parses experience entry dates (e.g., "May 2021 – Present") to calculate
        month-level duration. Handles various formats:
          - "Jan 2020 – Dec 2022"  → 36 months → 3 years
          - "May 2021 – Present"   → months until now
          - "2019 – 2021"          → 24 months → 2 years
          - "Aug 2025 - Current"   → months until now

        Falls back to year-only calculation if month abbreviations aren't found.
