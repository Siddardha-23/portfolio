"""
Workday Jobs service — powers the dedicated "Workday Jobs" tab.

Fans out across the curated, live-validated tenant catalog
(services/workday_tenant_catalog.py) hitting each tenant's public CXS JSON
endpoint directly:

    POST https://{tenant}.{wd_host}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs

No scraping, no Apify credits — the CXS API is the same JSON the public
career site renders from. Behavior notes confirmed by live probing:

  - With a `searchText` the response is relevance-sorted; without one it is
    newest-first. We search per derived term so a huge retail tenant's
    store-associate firehose doesn't bury the user's engineering titles.
  - `postedOn` is a relative phrase ("Posted Today", "Posted Yesterday",
    "Posted 2 Days Ago", "Posted 30+ Days Ago") — we convert to an absolute
    date and compute days_ago so the UI can filter Today/24h/3d/7d/30d
    client-side without a refetch.
  - Wrong site → 404, wrong host/tenant → 422. The catalog is pre-validated
    (scripts/validate_workday_tenants.py) so no runtime probing is needed.

Caching mirrors job_service's two-tier shape: we always fetch the widest
window (30 days) and cache that raw set in Mongo; recency filters are applied
downstream (client-side in the tab), so switching Today ↔ 30d is instant.
